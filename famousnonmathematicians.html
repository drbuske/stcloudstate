We often tell our students that there are many things besides teaching and actuarial work that they can do with a 
degree in
mathematics, but they often don't believe us. Here is a list of well-known people who were 
math
majors (or some equivalent in other countries and times), although not all of them completed their degrees.

    in math from the University of Chicago.<br>
</UL>
<UL>
  <li> <font color="#FF0000">Simeon DeWitt</font>, was the first math major at
